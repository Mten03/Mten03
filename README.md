### Hello, I'm Mitam! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at BloomTech hoping to become a web developer. I am currently working on polishing my knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I will be moving into React for my next learning unit. I am hoping to one day work at microsoft as an apprentice after my course at BloomTech. A fun fact about me would be that I love to spend my free time at the grocery store and in the kitchen trying out new recipes!
